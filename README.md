# INFO 494: User Trajectories

## How to Get Started

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo?tool=webui) this repository
2. Clone your fork on a computer
3. Create a Python environment on your computer
4. Write code

## How to Submit a Task

1. Once your code is ready to submit, make a [commit](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)
2. Make sure you don't commit any data or personal files!
3. Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Setup Recommendations

You are in charge of running your own Python code, which you can do either through the class's jupyterhub or on your own computer.Feel free to write code with whatever libraries you are comfortable with. The following are good defaults, if you aren't sure where to start:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing libraries
- [marimo](https://marimo.io/) for notebooks
- [polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars) for data processing
